# STOP/DJVU Ransomware Vaccine
 
Prevents STOP/DJVU Ransomware from encrypting your files.
This tool does not prevent the infection itself. 
STOP ransomware will still place ransom notes and may change settings on the systems. 
But STOP ransomware will not encrypt files anymore if the system has the vaccine.
Instead of a personal ID, the ransom notes will contain a string that files were protected by the vaccine.

**Notes:** Vaccines in general work by adding harmless parts of a malware to the system to trick it into believing the system is already infected. Antivirus software may detect the vaccine.

The vaccine may not work for future versions of this ransomware.
So if you already take the time to apply it, also take the time to backup your files!
